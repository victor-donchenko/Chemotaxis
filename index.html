		    This is a bird flock simulation. The birds follow your mouse pointer. Click to create a new bird. The birds have random colors. The birds try to stay with the flock, but they also try to spread apart. They tend to circle around the mouse pointer as they get nearer. Additionally, there's a random component to their flights.
